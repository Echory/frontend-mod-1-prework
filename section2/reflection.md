## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I think I struggle to ask questions because I worry I will sound stupid. I am learning to not be afraid to ask for help when I have worked on something for too long as that is not productive.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- I used replit to check my code as that is a resource I like and have used before. Sometimes it is hard when the answer is not right there but it is satisfying to find it on your own.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- Conditional statements will have a true or false response. In daily life there are many things that can be true or false. For example, did I have breakfast today? That will be true or false, yes or no. A conditional used in a web application would be on a liquor store website asking if you are 21 or older and then there is a box for yes and a box for no.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You can do this by using else. You can keep adding if else statements. The computer will run through each conditional. When it gets to the conditional that evaluates to true, it will stop and print out the outcome for that conditional.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- || and &&

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- Not a question so much as I just want to practice naming functions well.
