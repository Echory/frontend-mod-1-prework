## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- I find taking for frequent breaks really help my productivity but it is still hard to walk away sometimes.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I think setting intentions can make me more distracted because I get very overwhelmed trying to complete a task. For me it is easier to just work in the time frame and then take a break. I am easily distracted so sometimes the more I want to focus on something, the less I can.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is a data type that can contain many properties. An object represents one thing with multiple properties where an array contains multiple different things.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - Array because it is a list of names
  * List of states and their capitals
  - Object because the states have a property
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - Array because it is a list of items
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - Array because it is a list of account
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - Object because the student names have a property
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - Object because the ingredients have a property
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - Array as this is a list of restaurants without properties

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Goodreads could have an object that stores all the books you have saved. This could have keys like booksRead, wantToRead, dnfBooks. The value of these things could be the number of books or an array of the list of books.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- I found classes very difficult and while I understand their importance, I feel like I need a lot of practice with understanding the terminology.
