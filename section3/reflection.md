## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I resonated with seeing mistakes as learning and growth. It is important to learn from mistakes and not let them ruin our progress. I think I can also learn from setting S.M.A.R.T goals and not getting overwhelmed by problems that seem too big for me.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I currently demonstrate growth mindset by trying to learn from my mistakes. I think I can work on learning to ask for help when I am confused or stuck.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- A website for a clothing company can use an array to store peoples emails and then use that to send email promotions to all of the emails.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array is like a list where we can store data like strings, numbers, and booleans.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action over lines of code. We can use a loop to go through each index in an array or we could use a loop to go through an object that might contain multiple data types.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Loops go over something again and again until you want it to stop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I have questions about all the different kinds of loops and when the best time to use each of them is.
