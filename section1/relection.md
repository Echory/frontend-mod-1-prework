## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- I resonated with some parts of this article. I am a very avid reader and would say that I enjoy
learning. I agree that taking frequent breaks is important and probably the thing I have to work on the most. I would add patience to the list as learning something does not always come easy.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- Numbers: This data type is for numbers which includes positive, negative and decimals. The numbers do not need to be in quotes.
- String: A string can contain whatever you want it to. A string is in quotes and can be made up of words, numbers and symbols.
- Boolean: A boolean has a true or false value. This is helpful for questions that only have a true or false answer.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- // is how you leave a comment in Javascript. Comments allow us to expand on our ideas without interfering with our code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- We use variables to keep information that we can use and reference in the future.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- I use etsy pretty often. The name of a product would be a string, the price of the item would be a number, and if there was a question such as "are you above 18" that would be a boolean.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Using concatenation we can combine multiple variables to create one string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- Again for etsy, when I log in and it welcomes me back using my name, that would be usuing concatenation. So the sentence "welcome back" + my name.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- In what instance would concatenation be used over interpolation?
